# Prototype Pattern ‚Äì Event Ticketing System

## Problem Statement
When creating multiple similar objects (like event tickets), traditional object creation can be inefficient and repetitive. The challenges include:

1. **Expensive Object Creation**: Complex objects with heavy initialization costs
2. **Repetitive Setup**: Setting the same base properties for multiple objects
3. **Performance Issues**: Multiple constructor calls for similar objects
4. **Code Duplication**: Repeating initialization logic across the application
5. **Maintenance Overhead**: Changes to base properties require updates in multiple places

**Without a proper pattern**: You'd have expensive object creation, repeated initialization code, and performance bottlenecks when creating many similar objects.

## Solution: Prototype Pattern
The Prototype Pattern solves this by:
- **Cloning existing objects** instead of creating from scratch
- **Reusing initialized state** from prototype objects
- **Improving performance** by avoiding expensive constructor calls
- **Centralizing base configuration** in prototype templates
- **Enabling efficient mass object creation** with customization

## Overview
This project demonstrates the **Prototype Design Pattern** using an **Event Ticketing System**.  
The Prototype Pattern creates new objects by cloning an existing object, known as the prototype, instead of creating new instances from scratch through constructors.

## Use Case: Event Ticketing System
A ticketing system that efficiently creates multiple tickets for the same event:
- **Template-Based Creation** - one prototype ticket serves as a template for all others
- **Rapid Cloning** - create new tickets instantly by cloning the prototype
- **Consistent Base Properties** - all tickets share the same event name, price, and structure
- **Customizable Unique Properties** - each ticket gets unique seat, holder name, and barcode
- **Performance Optimization** - avoid expensive constructor calls for similar objects
- **Maintenance Efficiency** - change event details in one place, affects all future tickets

## Data Flow

### 1. **Prototype Creation**
```
Main ‚Üí Create EventTicket prototype ‚Üí Set base properties (eventName, price)
       ‚Üì
       Prototype ready with shared properties
       ‚Üì
       Prototype serves as template for all future tickets
```

### 2. **Ticket Cloning Process**
```
Request for new ticket ‚Üí Get prototype instance ‚Üí Call prototype.clone()
                        ‚Üì
                        New ticket created with copied base properties
                        ‚Üì
                        Customize unique properties (seat, holderName, barcode)
                        ‚Üì
                        Return customized ticket
```

### 3. **Property Inheritance & Customization**
```
Base Properties (Shared):
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ eventName: "Concert Night"     ‚Üê Same for all tickets
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ price: $99.99                  ‚Üê Same for all tickets
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ structure: Ticket format       ‚Üê Same for all tickets

Unique Properties (Customized):
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ seat: A1, A2, A3...           ‚Üê Different for each ticket
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ holderName: Alice, Bob, Carol ‚Üê Different for each ticket
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ barcode: BC123, BC456, BC789  ‚Üê Different for each ticket
```

### 4. **Comparison: With vs Without Prototype**
```
WITH PROTOTYPE (Efficient):
Prototype ‚Üí Clone ‚Üí Customize ‚Üí Done
(1 constructor call + customization)

WITHOUT PROTOTYPE (Traditional):
Constructor ‚Üí Set all properties ‚Üí Done
(Full constructor call for each ticket)
```

## Pattern Components

| Component | Purpose | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Prototype Interface** | Defines cloning contract | `TicketPrototype.clone()` |
| **Concrete Prototype** | Implements cloning logic | `EventTicket.clone()` |
| **Client** | Requests object cloning | `PrototypeDemo.main()` |
| **Clone Operation** | Creates copy of prototype | `prototype.clone()` |

## How It Works

### 1. **Prototype Interface (TicketPrototype)**
- **Defines clone method** that all prototypes must implement
- **Ensures consistent cloning behavior** across different object types
- **Provides type-safe cloning** with proper return types
- **Establishes contract** for prototype implementations

### 2. **Concrete Prototype (EventTicket)**
- **Implements clone method** with custom logic
- **Copies base properties** (eventName, price) to new instance
- **Generates unique properties** (barcode) for each clone
- **Allows customization** of variable properties (seat, holderName)

### 3. **Cloning Implementation**
- **Efficient copying** of shared properties
- **Unique identifier generation** for each clone
- **Customization hooks** for specific properties
- **Performance optimization** over constructor-based creation

### 4. **Client Usage (PrototypeDemo)**
- **Creates prototype once** with base properties
- **Clones prototype multiple times** for different tickets
- **Customizes each clone** with unique information
- **Demonstrates efficiency** of prototype approach
