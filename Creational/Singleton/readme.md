# Singleton Pattern â€“ Weather Data Caching System

## Problem Statement
In multi-threaded applications, managing shared resources like caches can lead to several issues:

1. **Multiple Instance Creation**: Different parts of the application creating separate cache instances
2. **Memory Waste**: Multiple cache instances consuming unnecessary memory
3. **Data Inconsistency**: Different caches holding different versions of the same data
4. **Synchronization Issues**: Thread-safe access to shared cache data
5. **Resource Contention**: Multiple instances competing for the same external resources (APIs)

**Without a proper pattern**: You'd have memory inefficiency, data inconsistency, and potential race conditions in multi-threaded environments.

## Solution: Singleton Pattern
The Singleton Pattern solves this by:
- **Ensuring single instance** throughout the application lifecycle
- **Providing global access point** to the shared resource
- **Thread-safe implementation** using double-checked locking
- **Memory efficiency** by preventing multiple instances
- **Consistent data access** across all application components

## Overview
This project demonstrates the **Singleton Design Pattern** using a **Weather Data Caching System**.  
The Singleton Pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance throughout the application.

## Use Case: Weather Data Caching System
A multi-threaded weather application that demonstrates efficient data caching:
- **Centralized Cache Management** - single cache instance shared across all threads
- **API Call Optimization** - prevents redundant API calls for the same city
- **Thread-Safe Operations** - safe concurrent access to shared cache
- **Memory Efficiency** - single cache instance reduces memory footprint
- **Performance Improvement** - cached data eliminates expensive API calls
- **Consistent Data Access** - all threads access the same cached weather data

## Data Flow

### 1. **Application Initialization**
```
Main.java â†’ Creates multiple WeatherRequestThread instances
           â†’ Each thread represents a city weather request
           â†’ Threads start concurrently to simulate real-world usage
```

### 2. **Weather Data Request Flow**
```
WeatherRequestThread â†’ WeatherCache.getInstance() â†’ Singleton Cache Instance
                     â†“
                     Check if city exists in cache
                     â†“
                     If CACHED: Return cached weather data
                     If NOT CACHED: WeatherService.fetchWeatherFromAPI()
                     â†“
                     Store new data in cache
                     â†“
                     Return weather data to thread
```

### 3. **Singleton Cache Operations**
```
Thread Request â†’ getInstance() â†’ Double-Checked Locking â†’ Cache Instance
               â†“
               Synchronized access to cache methods
               â†“
               contains() â†’ Check if city exists
               get() â†’ Retrieve cached weather data
               put() â†’ Store new weather data
```

### 4. **Thread Safety Implementation**
```
Multiple Threads â†’ Concurrent access to WeatherCache
                  â†“
                  Double-checked locking pattern
                  â†“
                  Synchronized cache operations
                  â†“
                  Safe concurrent read/write operations
```

## Pattern Components

| Component | Purpose | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Singleton Class** | Manages single cache instance | `WeatherCache` |
| **Private Constructor** | Prevents external instantiation | `private WeatherCache()` |
| **Static Instance** | Holds the single instance | `private static volatile WeatherCache instance` |
| **Thread-Safe Access** | Provides synchronized access | `public static WeatherCache getInstance()` |
| **Cache Operations** | Manages weather data storage | `contains()`, `get()`, `put()` methods |

## Execution Flow Example
```
Thread-0 requests Chennai â†’ Cache miss â†’ API call â†’ Store in cache
Thread-1 requests Mumbai â†’ Cache miss â†’ API call â†’ Store in cache  
Thread-2 requests Chennai â†’ Cache hit â†’ Return cached data
Thread-3 requests Delhi â†’ Cache miss â†’ API call â†’ Store in cache
Thread-4 requests Mumbai â†’ Cache hit â†’ Return cached data

- Cache hits and misses for different cities
- Thread-safe access to the shared cache
- Performance benefits of caching (avoiding redundant API calls)
