# Observer Pattern â€“ Quiz Notification System

## Problem Statement
In systems where one object needs to notify multiple dependent objects about state changes, direct coupling creates several challenges:

1. **Tight Coupling**: Subject directly depends on specific observer implementations
2. **Static Relationships**: Fixed relationships between subjects and observers
3. **Broadcast Complexity**: Manual notification of multiple dependent objects
4. **Maintenance Issues**: Adding/removing observers requires changing subject code
5. **Inconsistent Updates**: Risk of forgetting to notify some dependent objects

**Without a proper pattern**: The quiz master would need to maintain a list of specific student objects and manually call methods on each one when questions are added.

## Solution: Observer Pattern
The Observer Pattern solves this by:
- **Creating loose coupling** between subjects and observers through interfaces
- **Enabling dynamic subscriptions** where observers can register/unregister at runtime
- **Providing automatic notifications** to all registered observers
- **Supporting multiple observer types** without changing subject code
- **Ensuring consistent updates** across all dependent objects

## Overview
This project demonstrates the **Observer Design Pattern** using a **Quiz Notification System**.  
In an educational setting, when a quiz master adds new questions, all registered students need to be notified automatically. Instead of manually notifying each student, the **Observer Pattern** creates a subscription mechanism where students receive updates whenever new questions are added.

The **Observer Pattern** helps:
- **Decouple subjects from observers** - quiz master doesn't need to know about individual students
- **Enable dynamic subscriptions** - students can join/leave notifications at runtime
- **Maintain loose coupling** - changes in one component don't affect others

## Use Case: Educational Quiz System
Imagine a classroom scenario where:
- A **Quiz Master** creates and adds new questions
- **Students** want to be notified whenever new questions are posted
- **Dynamic registration** - students can join or leave the notification list
- **Automatic updates** - all registered students get notified simultaneously

The Observer Pattern creates a **publisher-subscriber relationship**:
- **Quiz Master** (Subject) publishes new questions
- **Students** (Observers) subscribe to receive notifications
- **Automatic notification** happens whenever questions are added

## Folder Structure
```
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ subscribers/
â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ Subject.java          # Interface for observable objects
â”‚ â”‚ â””â”€â”€ Observer.java          # Interface for observers
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ quiz/
â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ Quiz.java             # Concrete subject (quiz master)
â”‚ â”‚ â””â”€â”€ Student.java          # Concrete observer (students)
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ Main.java               # Main demonstration
```

## How It Works

### 1. **Subject Interface**
- Defines methods to **register** and **remove** observers
- Defines method to **notify** all registered observers
- **Quiz class** implements this interface

### 2. **Observer Interface**
- Defines the **update method** that subjects call
- **Student class** implements this interface
- Each observer can define its own response to updates

### 3. **Quiz (Concrete Subject)**
- **Maintains a list** of registered students
- **Implements Subject interface** methods
- **Notifies all students** when new questions are added
- **Manages observer lifecycle** (add/remove students)

### 4. **Student (Concrete Observer)**
- **Implements Observer interface**
- **Receives automatic updates** when questions are posted
- **Defines personal response** to notifications
- **Can be dynamically added/removed** from the notification list

## Workflow Example

```
1. Quiz Master creates a new quiz
2. Students register as observers:
   - Alice subscribes to notifications
   - Bob subscribes to notifications  
   - Charlie subscribes to notifications

3. Quiz Master adds questions:
   - "What is the capital of France?" â†’ All 3 students notified
   - "Solve: 5 * 6 = ?" â†’ All 3 students notified

4. Bob unsubscribes from notifications

5. Quiz Master adds another question:
   - "Who developed Java?" â†’ Only Alice and Charlie notified
```

## Key Benefits

âœ… **Loose Coupling**: Subjects and observers are independent  
âœ… **Dynamic Relationships**: Observers can join/leave at runtime  
âœ… **Automatic Updates**: No manual notification needed  
âœ… **Scalability**: Easy to add more observers without changing subjects  
âœ… **Maintainability**: Changes in one component don't affect others  

## When to Use Observer

- **One-to-many relationships** between objects
- **Automatic notification** is needed when state changes
- **Dynamic subscription management** is required
- **Decoupling** between event source and event handlers

---

## Real-World Applications

- **Event Handling**: GUI frameworks, user interface updates
- **Model-View Architecture**: Data changes automatically update UI
- **Notification Systems**: Email alerts, push notifications
- **Game Development**: Score updates, achievement notifications
- **Social Media**: News feed updates, friend activity notifications

## Pattern Components

| Component | Purpose | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Subject** | Manages observers and sends notifications | Quiz Master |
| **Observer** | Receives updates from subjects | Students |
| **Concrete Subject** | Implements subject interface | Quiz class |
| **Concrete Observer** | Implements observer interface | Student class |

## Implementation Notes

- **Subject maintains observer list** using ArrayList
- **Observer pattern with interfaces** for flexibility
- **Dynamic registration/removal** of observers
- **Automatic notification** on state changes
- **Clean separation** of concerns between quiz logic and student notifications

## ðŸš€ How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Java 8 or higher
- Java IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code) or command line

### Compilation & Execution Steps

1. **Navigate to the Observer directory**
   ```bash
   cd Behavioural/Observer/src
   ```

2. **Compile all Java files**
   ```bash
   javac *.java */*.java
   ```

3. **Run the quiz notification demo**
   ```bash
   java Main
   ```

### Expected Output
The program will demonstrate:
- Students registering as observers for quiz notifications
- Quiz master adding questions and automatically notifying all registered students
- Dynamic subscription management (students joining/leaving notifications)
- Observer pattern enabling loose coupling between quiz and students
- Automatic broadcast of updates to multiple observers

### Alternative IDE Execution
1. Open the project in your Java IDE
2. Navigate to `Main.java`
3. Right-click and select "Run" or press the run button
4. View the quiz notification system output in the IDE console
